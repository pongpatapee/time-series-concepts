# Time Series Analysis Concepts

Learning about Time Series concepts such as core characteristics, statistical analysis, various types of forecasting models.

## Core Concepts

### What is Time Series Data

Time series data is characterized by being recorded at specific times/intervals (hourly, daily, monthly, etc.), and where **the time at which the data occured** is curcial for analysis.

Ex: stock prices, weather data, sensory data, sales data (ad-tech)

### What is a Time Series Forecasting Model

It is a method/algorithm used to predict future data based on historical data, by capturing patterns like _trends_, _seasonality_, and _cyclic behavior_ in historical data. Takes into account the sequential nature of data, where each observation is dependent on the previous.

### Stationality

## Types of Models and examples

### Statistical Models

- Auto Regressive (AR)
- Moving Average (MA)
- ARMA (Auto Regressive Moving Average)
- ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
- Holt-Winter Exponential Smoothing
- VAR (Vector Auto Regressive)
- Prophet
  - Model developed by Facebook

### ML/DL models

- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- LSTMs
- CNNs
- Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)
- Neural Prophet
